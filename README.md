# SpaPred
SpaPred aims to automatically predict the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The heterogeneity of tumors, the diversity of tumor spatial structural characteristics, and the complexity of TIME make it extremely challenging to accurately analyze the composition and distribution of ST segment data in liver cancer patients. Therefore, the multi-algorithm fusion model (SpaPred) aimed at automatically generating the TIME subtype and tumor spatial structural information for each spot.
